\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This report captures the research strategy for classifying six emotions from $64\times64$ inputs, where every design choice balances the limited signal with the need for interpretable predictions of happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. Each section then presents the technical rationale from the supporting documents—data sourcing, architecture design, optimisation, and evaluation—so future work inherits the same assumptions and metrics.

Rather than recounting implementation steps, the document builds a shared vocabulary that frames architectural choices within dataset heterogeneity, regularisation, and explainability, and the conclusion revisits the discussed alternatives to guide the ongoing implementation.
